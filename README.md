# LPJS-Extensions
3rd party extensions to LPJS

# Description
This is a gathering point for developing and discussing extensions to LPJS (Lightweight, Portable
Job Scheduler).  LPJS itself is committed to supporting all POSIX platforms.  This project, and
other separate projects, can be used to support platform-specific features (e.g. FreeBSD jails,
Linux cgroups, etc.) and any other features not deemed appropriate to be part of the LPJS base.
